        Parameters
        ----------
        distinguish_regions : bool, default: True
            If True, locations in different regions will use different
            marker colours.
        distinguish_depots bool, default: True
            If True, depot locations will be marked with crosses
            rather than circles.  Their labels will also be in
            CAPITALS, and underneath their markers, if not toggled
            off.
        location_names : bool, default: True
            If True, all locations will be annotated with their names.
        polar_projection : bool, default: True
            If True, the plot will display as a polar
            projection. Disable this if you would prefer the plot to
            be displayed in Cartesian (x,y) space.
        save_to : Path, str
            Providing a file name or path will result in the diagram
            being saved to that location. NOTE: This will suppress the
            display of the figure via matplotlib.

        Parameters
        ----------

            A list of Locations in the country, where consecutive
